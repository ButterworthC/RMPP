<h2>Unit 1: <!-- Introduction to Research Methods. The Scientific Investigation and -->
Ethics in Computing</h2>
<p>I found the Association for Computing Machinery's Code of Ethics <a href="#acm2018">ACM, 2018</a>) and its case studies (<a href="#acmnd">ACM, n.d.</a>), 
and the British Computer Society's Code of Conduct (<a href="#bcs">BCS, 2022</a>),
to be rooted in common sense but, as BCS admits: "It is expected that these rules and professional standards 
will be higher than those established by the general law 
and that they will be enforced through disciplinary action which can result in expulsion from membership."
In other words, these rules are toothless. A statutory framework would have more of a bite and would help close the gap in compliance.</p>
<p>Those were just two governance frameworks but a recent paper (<a href="#correa">Corr&ecirc;a, 2023</a>) examines 200 such frameworks, in the form of a survey of surveys,
aiming "to determine whether a consensus exists regarding the normative discourse presented in ethical guidelines surrounding AI development"
and concluding (like me) that there is a "need for comprehensive and enforceable frameworks to guide ethical AI development and usage."</p>

<h2>Unit 2: Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal</h2>

<h2>Unit 3: Methodology and Research Methods</h2>

<h2>Unit 4: Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h2>
<h3>Unit 4 Seminar: Case Study on Privacy</h3>
Beth asks Ricardo to retrieve names and addresses, so she can contact people for information and permission to use it.<br>
<ul>
<li>As Ricardo is not responsible for determining allowable access, he should not release it to Beth, as this would be a violation of GDPR's
lawfulness, fairness, and transparency principles (<a href="#eu2016">European Union, 2016</a>).</li>
<li>If he did have authority, he should still respect people's privacy rights (under GDPR again) to maintain public trust.</li>
<li>Beth should not contact people directly to let them opt in but go through her department.</li>
<li>For Beth to proceed she should perhaps adjust the boundary under study until she reaches 50% coverage, but this could skew the data.</li>
</ul>
